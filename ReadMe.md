# System info service (working title)

This service will expose various routes that give infomation about the cpu / hardware.  
This will eventually be used to create a dashboard for my raspberry pi's

I'm exposing the commented out functions in system_wrapper at the moment.  I will need to build the frontend later.

 ## current (1-30-21) next steps
 * Build out the rest of the API
 * Install on all of the Pi's
 * Write frontend using react chart or graph or something.
